The research explores the atomic-level distribution of the water molecules and ions within the Zika virus. By using coarse-grained simulations with the ComplexMixtures.jl package, the study analyzed the distribution patterns across the viral structure, revealing specific differences and affinities regarding light-materials.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Dependencies","page":"Supplementary Information of Mapping the Microenvironment in Zika Virus Dynamics","title":"Dependencies","text":"This work was developed using the following software and packages:\n\nJulia 1.11.2: Programming language.\nComplexMixtures v2.10.1: For light-material distribution analysis.\nLaTeXStrings v1.4.0: For incorporating LaTeX-style formatting in plot labbels and annotations. \nPDBTools v2.1.2: For handling and analyzing PDB files.\nPlots v1.40.9: For generating high-quality visualizations.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Supplementary Information of Mapping the Microenvironment in Zika Virus Dynamics","title":"Installation","text":"The dependencies can be installed in Julia using:\n\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add([\n    \"ComplexMixtures\",\n    \"LaTeXStrings\",\n    \"PDBTools\",\n    \"Plots\"\n])\n\nwarning: Compatibility\nEnsure that you are using Julia 1.11.2 for compatibility with the packages and scipts in the repository.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Funding","page":"Supplementary Information of Mapping the Microenvironment in Zika Virus Dynamics","title":"Funding","text":"The authors acknowledge the financial support of Fapesp (2018/24293-0, 2023/14353-4).
