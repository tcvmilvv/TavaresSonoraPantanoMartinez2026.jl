The study examines how water molecules and ions are spatially organized within the Zika virus at atomic resolution. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, analyzed with the ComplexMixtures.jl framework, were employed to map these distributions across the viral structure, highlighting localized preferences and differential interactions with the surrounding molecular components.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Dependencies","page":"Home","title":"Dependencies","text":"This work was developed using the following software and packages:\n\nJulia 1.11.2: Programming language.\nComplexMixtures v2.10.1: For light-material distribution analysis.\nLaTeXStrings v1.4.0: For incorporating LaTeX-style formatting in plot labbels and annotations. \nPDBTools v2.1.2: For handling and analyzing PDB files.\nPlots v1.40.9: For generating high-quality visualizations.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"The dependencies can be installed in Julia using:\n\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add([\n    \"ComplexMixtures\",\n    \"LaTeXStrings\",\n    \"PDBTools\",\n    \"Plots\"\n])\n\nwarning: Compatibility\nEnsure that you are using Julia 1.11.2 for compatibility with the packages and scipts in the repository.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Funding","page":"Home","title":"Funding","text":"The authors acknowledge the financial support of Fapesp (2018/24293-0, 2023/14353-4).
